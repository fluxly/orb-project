# The Open Redaction Blocks (ORB) Project

What we did is extract all of the large black blocks in the Mueller Report as individual works of art. These individual works are called ORBs (Open Redaction Blocks).

The mission of the ORB Project is to provide an open set of data and visual assets to allow artists and designers easy access to ORBs for use in their creative works. All ORB assets and data are released under a Creative Commons license, and are available for free to the public at [http://orb-project.us](http://orb-project.us) and here on Github.

On this site you can view and download individual blocks from the gallery. We will also highlight creative projects using the blocks, as they appear. The first project to use Open Redacted Blocks is an iOS game called [Redacted Tower](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/redacted-tower/id1463453940), available now in the App store.
